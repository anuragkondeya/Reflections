How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

As only the difference were shown, I had to just read through the differences to find the bug rather than reading through the whole file.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

By looking at the history, I can find patterns in my mistakes which I can avoid in future. Also I can find patterns in my programming styles using which I can design the code structure better. 
    

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

 
pros. Those code which can logically concluded goes into the history rather than every change. This way my history is short and provides me with quick progress summary.
2. Automatically saving a commit can save half changes and incomplete code which might not run when you revert to it

cons. 1.I am at the more risk of loosing changes if committing manually as compared to committing automatically.
      


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

For logical grouping. Git works better in an environment where a developer is changing multiple files to achieve one task. Whereas google docs, as a document editor will often has a person dedicatedly working on a single document.     


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log
git diff old new




How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

With version control, if anything goes wrong, i can always revert back to last working version and hence i need not remember each and every change i made.  


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Save the first draft of this document and experience how git works.
